# About me 🙋‍♀️
My name is Monika Łękawa. I am 5th year student of AGH University in Cracow 👩‍🎓. I received a bachelor degree for a thesis about cognitive linguistics from the Jagiellonian University, Faculty of Polish Studies. Currently, I study Visual Communication and Graphic Design on AGH University, Faculty of Cultural Studies. 

From the beginning of my master's studies I see my future in IT. Initially, I was planning to develop my skills on the UX/UI path. During the first year of my master's studies, I designed a mobile application in Figma. I added its initial outline to the My projects section. 

However, when I explored the issues of testing and QA work, I decided that this is the field I want to develop. So far I written test cases in Gherkin of [RespolHPL e-commerce](https://respolhpl-sklep.pl). I made the report of bugs on Jira and I written the test plan and test report in Google Docs. I made basic API automation tests in Postman. I study a book: "Certyfikowany tester ISTQB. Poziom podstawowy" by Adam Roman and Lucjan Stapp. Also I'm currently taking a PostgreSQL course on Udemy, where I am learning the basics of relational databases, writing queries for PostgreSQL databases, and how to modify and create simple tables and views.
