# About me 🙋‍♀️
My name is Monika Łękawa. I am 5th year student of AGH University in Cracow 👩‍🎓. I graduated with a bachelor degree from the Jagiellonian University, Faculty of Polish Studies. Currently, I study Cultural studies - second cycle studies - Visual communication and graphic design on AGH University. From the beginning of my master's studies I see my future in IT. Initially, I was plan to develop my skills on the UX/UI path. During the first year of my master's studies, I designed a mobile application. I added its initial outline to the My projects section. However, when I explored the issues of testing and QA work, I decided that this is the field I want to develop. So far I written test case of online shop Respol and the report of bags. I also study topics included in the International Software Testing Qualifications Board syllabus available online for free.
