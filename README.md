# About me 🙋‍♀️
My name is Monika, and I'm a 5th-year student at AGH University in Krakow 👩‍🎓. I earned my bachelor's degree for a thesis on cognitive linguistics from the Jagiellonian University, Faculty of Polish Studies. Currently, I'm studying Visual Communication and Graphic Design at AGH University, Faculty of Cultural Studies.

Since the beginning of my master's studies, I have envisioned my future in IT. Initially, I planned to develop my skills in the UX/UI field. During the first year of my master's studies, I designed a mobile application using Figma. I have included its initial outline in the 'My projects' section.

However, upon exploring the aspects of testing and QA work, I have decided that this is the field I want to pursue. So far I have written test cases in Gherkin for the [RespolHPL e-commerce](https://respolhpl-sklep.pl) platform. I have made the report of bugs on Jira and created the test plan and test report in Google Docs. Additionally, I have conducted basic API automation tests in Postman. I am currently studying the book 'Certyfikowany tester ISTQB. Poziom podstawowy' by Adam Roma, Lucjan Stapp and Michaël Pilaeten.

Furthermore, I am currently enrolled in a PostgreSQL course on Udemy, where I am learning the basics of relational databases, writing queries for PostgreSQL databases, and how to modify and create simple tables and views. I am also exploring the area of non-functional testing, including performance, security, usability and accessibility tests.
